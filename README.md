# resume
A single-page resume wholly typeset with HTML and CSS forked from awesome repository [mnjul/html-resume](https://github.com/mnjul/html-resume).

Check [here](https://levispace.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/levi_guo_resume.pdf) to check the sample resume :)

## Updates
1. Added description for your position and company.
2. Added highlight for titles in sidebar.
3. Update the consistency of the font.
4. Moved time aligned with job title on the right hand side (people tend to be read from left to right, so always let them read the more important thing on the left hand side)
5. Highlighted and bolded the name (you are not just showing people your resume, you are branding your name!)
